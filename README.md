# ProcessWire Scripts
Handy installation and post installation scripts for ProcessWire.

Place files in your path and set them to executable. ``chmod +x filename``

Tested on OSX and reported to be compatible with Debian (Wheezy).

**You might need to change the default permissions and site profiles in the files.**
